9. Create a README file and write your name and UW NetID. Include a paragraph of instructions on how you used git commands to add, commit, and push to your repository (3-5 sentences).

First you need to add the changes, use the command "git add '" then hit enter. Now use "git status". Now you need to commit the changes, use "git commit m" then add your own commit message.
